Play Flappy Bird Using Deep Reinforcement Learning
Overview
This project implements a Deep Q-Network (DQN) agent that learns to play Flappy Bird through reinforcement learning. The agent learns by interacting with the environment, receiving rewards for staying alive and passing through pipes, and penalties for crashing.
Features

Pygame-based Flappy Bird environment
Deep Q-Network (DQN) implementation
Experience replay for stable learning
Epsilon-greedy exploration strategy
Visualization of training progress
