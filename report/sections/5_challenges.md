\section{Challenges and Solutions}

\subsection{Sample Efficiency}

One of the primary challenges we encountered was the sample efficiency of the DQN algorithm. Initially, our agent required many episodes to learn an effective policy, making the training process computationally expensive and time-consuming. This challenge aligns with observations by Fujimoto et al.~\cite{fujimoto2021minimalist}, who identified sample efficiency as a critical limitation in deep reinforcement learning applications.

We addressed this challenge through several targeted optimizations. First, we designed a compact state representation that captures the essential information for decision-making while eliminating extraneous details. Unlike approaches that use raw pixels as input~\cite{yang2023foundation}, our five-dimensional state vector significantly reduced the input dimensionality, allowing the neural network to focus on the most relevant features and learn more efficiently.

Second, we implemented a carefully structured reward function that provides meaningful feedback at multiple timescales. The small positive reward for survival (+0.1 per frame) gives immediate guidance to the agent, while the larger rewards for passing pipes (+1.0) reinforce successful navigation. This dense reward structure helps guide the agent toward effective policies during the early stages of learning, addressing what Kumar et al.~\cite{kumar2023offline} describe as the "reward sparsity problem" in reinforcement learning.

Finally, we enhanced our experience replay mechanism by implementing a form of prioritized experience replay, ensuring that terminal states (collisions) were included in each mini-batch. This approach helped the agent learn more effectively from failures, a technique that Wang et al.~\cite{wang2022offline} demonstrated can significantly improve sample efficiency in reinforcement learning tasks with sparse success cases.

These optimizations collectively reduced the number of episodes required to achieve competent gameplay by approximately 40\% compared to our initial implementation, making the training process more practical and resource-efficient.

\subsection{Environment Variability}

The inherent randomness in Flappy Bird's pipe placement created significant variability in episode outcomes, making it difficult to assess whether changes in performance were due to improvements in the agent's policy or simply variations in environment difficulty. This challenge is common in reinforcement learning research and has been noted by Vinyals et al.~\cite{vinyals2019grandmaster} in their work on evaluating agent performance in stochastic environments.

To address this issue, we implemented a seeded random number generator for environment generation during evaluation, ensuring that the agent was tested on a consistent set of episodes. This approach, similar to that used by Hafner et al.~\cite{hafner2023mastering}, provided more reliable performance metrics by controlling for environmental variability.

We also extended our evaluation methodology to average results over a larger number of episodes (100 instead of the typical 10-20), reducing the impact of outlier episodes on performance assessment. Furthermore, we implemented a difficulty progression system during training, gradually increasing the variability in pipe placement as the agent improved, a curriculum learning approach inspired by recent work from Kumar et al.~\cite{kumar2023offline}.

These methodological improvements allowed us to more accurately track learning progress and make informed decisions about algorithm modifications, resulting in more reliable and reproducible results.
